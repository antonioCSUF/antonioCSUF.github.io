### CPSC 120

* lab 6

   Lab 6, part 2 was probably the most interesting out of the three because the correlation between math and code.I like the lesson in math on the probabiliy of a dice landing on a number.
   For me at least how like how there was connection between that, and just the game of black jack was cool. Learning the game in my lecture and then later implementing that into the lab
   was nice.

* Lab 4

  Lab 4, part 1 was also one of my favorites because of the learning experience that I was taught by my partner. It was on the implementation of doubles that used to convert measurements of
  volume into a metric system, by the end of it I had a grasp on doubles. Even the conversions were a challenge to me at least which really had me wanting to push.

* Lab 11

  Lab 11, part 1 is the last of my favorite not only cause it was tuff for me and my partner but when we had finished it gave me immense joy which made me like this lab even more.
  What I liked was the problem it gave us on using a function of price divided calories multiplied by 2000. Me and my partner were really glad that function ended up working and
  after the testing had been approved it felt good.
